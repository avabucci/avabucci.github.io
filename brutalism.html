			<p>Brutalist design is an architectural form distinguished by purposeful simplicity, crudeness, and clarity, which can be regarded as severe and intimidating. Featuring visually heavy edifices with geometric lines, solid concrete frames, exaggerated slabs, double height ceilings, massive forbidding walls, exposed concrete and a predominantly monochrome palette, brutalist buildings prioritised function over form, and stripped-back minimalism over flashy design.</p>

			<h3> Habitat 67 in Montreal, Canada </h3>
			<p> Habitat 67, designed by the Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie as the Canadian Pavilion for the World Exposition of 1967, was originally intended as an experimental solution for high-quality housing in dense urban environments. Safdie explored the possibilities of prefabricated modular units to reduce housing costs and allow for a new housing typology that could integrate the qualities of a suburban home into an urban high-rise. Habitat 67 was constructed from 354 identical and completely prefabricated modules (referred to as “boxes”) stacked in various combinations and connected by steel cables. The apartments vary in shape and size, since they are formed by a group of one to four of the 600 square-foot “boxes” in different configurations. Each apartment is reached through a series of pedestrian streets and bridges, along with three vertical cores of elevators for the top floors.</p>

			<h3> The Frick Madison in New York City, New York </h3>
			<p> The Breuer building, which originally housed the Whitney Museum of American Art and opened in 1966, was leased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the last five years, and became known as the Met Breuer. Now named the Frick Madison, the Brutalist architecture houses the collection’s highlights, organized geographically and chronologically. A series of gray-walled galleries, designed by Selldorf and the team, propel guests counterclockwise, while floor-to-ceiling openings and cross-vistas tease new connections between works of art that have previously only been seen in a dense residential setting. And there are no texts or titles, adding to the drama of Selldorf’s substantial gray walls that make transitions between rooms more noticeable. The Frick Madison is filled with concrete ceilings, cement walls, and slate floors to complete the brutalist environment.</p>

			<h3> The Giesel Library in San Diego, California </h3>
			<p> The alien form of the Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego seems befitting of a backdrop from a science fiction movie. The building occupies a fascinating nexus between brutalism and futurism that its architect, William Pereira, intrepidly pursued throughout his career. With its strong concrete piers and hovering glassy enclosures, the library beautifully occupies an ambiguous state between massiveness and levitation, as if the upper stories have only just been set into their base and can be lifted back out at any moment. The tension between these two conditions gives the library an otherworldly appearance and provides a startling statement about the generative and imaginative power of the architect. To develop the schematic design for the library, Pereira analyzed and categorized dozens of university libraries by their massing, circulation, and programmatic arrangements. He theorized about which forms were more effective than others at providing certain functions that he valued, such as daylight in the stacks, the ability to browse the shelves, and the potential for future expansion. Using rudimentary diagrams as the basis of his design, he theorized that partially submerging the library would allow maximum potential for expansion and would bury the elements of the library that were not necessary above ground. For the aboveground portion, he wanted access to emanate from a singular point at the ground level, with a central core connecting the different floors. The most logical shape for a library, he concluded, would therefore be a sphere, which could maximize daylight to the floors, provide a variety of flexible floor arrangements, and maintain an ideal central circulation system. Even though the spherical exterior was ultimately abandoned for this project, Periera preserved the underlying concept of a large middle floor with tapered, smaller floors below and above.</p>
